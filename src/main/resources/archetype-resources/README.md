### Rubric

| Criteria | Total Points |
| --- | --- |
| Source file comment headers | 1 |
| Coding style (clean and consistent) | 1 |
| At least one unique commit per milestone | 3 |
| Correctness (tests) | 5 |

The points for correctness are evenly split across all tests; you can determine how much each test is worth by dividing 5 by the number of tests.
For example, if the skeleton code has 4 tests, each test will be worth 1.25 points.

Similarly, if you divide 3 by the number of milestones, you'll know how many points each milestone commit is worth.
